# Odin_GoogleHomePage

I completed this project while working through The Odin Project, an online web development tutorial.

The purpose of this project is to, as accurately as possible, replicate the Google home page with HTML and CSS.  

## Things I learned

While completing this project, I got a lot of practice in CSS.  I learned to use the DOM inspector in the browser to determine the exact measurements of a DOM element on a page.
